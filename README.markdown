About
=====
Shibboleth's Lil Helper (slh) is a tool that automates the generation of Apache/IIS Shibboleth Native Service Provider configuration & metadata files.  It provides several benefits over manually configuring each NativeSp instance/server by:

* __Providing a consistent configuration approach__ you can apply uniformly across all of the servers managed by your organization.
  * Makes deployment automation possible, errors less frequent, and troubleshooting easier.

* __Dividing high level auth specs from actual NativeSp configuration__
  * Programmers can focus on high level goals like "protect files underneath the '/secure' directory on 'somewebsite.com'" rather than grappeling with the bewildering complexity of the NativeSp's interrelated XML files, the Shibboleth protocal, SAML, etc.

* __Providing conceptually simple linear process__ that distills the main steps associated with Shibboleth integration.

* Verifying metadata consistency across sites & hosts associated with
  particular Shibboletht SP entity_id.

DISCLAIMER
-------------------------
All you see here on Github is the readme, no code yet.

This is released as a RubyGem right now, we hope to push the source up
here once things stabilize further

Why another tool?
-----------------
We needed something that could help manage shibboleth SP
configuration consistently with minimal manual work for:

* Many web servers
  * each running iis6, iis7, or Apache 2.2
  * each hosting many vhosts (aka sites)
  * each running PHP, Rails 2 + 3, classic ASP, or .NET
  * each running the Apache/IIS Native Service Provider

Installation
============
* Pre-requisites:
  * Rubygems: http://rubygems.org/pages/download

* Via Ruby Gems:
  * gem install shibboleths_lil_helper
  * Then type `slh` -- this provides more detailed/actionable
    documentation

Assumptions
===========
* Shibboleth Native Service Provider Apache/IIS is already installed on your target web servers.
* The X509Certificate (sp-cert.pem, sp-key.pem) keys are in their default locations along-side shibboleth2.xml.
* The Shibboleth apache module is loaded globally for all vHosts.
* You are integrating with a single Identity Provider.

Concept
=======

All configuration and authentication specs for all Shibboleth SP instances are specified in a single ruby parseable "shibboleths_lil_helper/config.rb" file.  From these specs, slh is capable of generating all of the required XML files you will need to integrate with a Shibboleth Identify Provider (Idp).

The generation of these XML files happens through a command line tool
called "slh".  Each particular task is broken into sub-commands such as
"initialize", "generate", "verify_metadata", or "generate_metadata" that perform various tasks.

* It all starts with:

    mkdir shibboleth_deployer
    cd shibboleth_deployer
    slh initialize

  This creates a config file with example code you'll need to change to work.

* Go in and edit shibboleths_lil_helper/config.rb to reflect your setup,
  adding
  * entity id
  * idp metadata url
  * hosts, sites, and paths to protect for each for each site


* From here you type:

    slh generate

  which will generate shibboleth2.xml and a couple others
  Now--you go put these files on the hosts they have been generated for.

* The generated shibboleth2.xml will have RequestMap specs that restrict
  access to specified paths you have


* Once you've copied the shibboleth2.xml up to your target hosts, you
  can type:

    slh verify_metadata

  which will tell some of the things that are probably incorrect with
  your setup and how to fix it. (like copying the sp-key.pem and sp-cert.pem keys associated with the :is_key_originator site to all of the other hosts)

* Then, once verify_metadata is showing all green:

    slh generate_metadata

  which generates a metadata file for each strategy/entity id you have
that you can give you your IDP.

Real World Example
==================
The following describes how we integrate this tool's generated output
into a deployment automation tool called Capistrano.

We have a private repo called shibboleth_deployer that includes the shibboleths_lil_helper generated config files and uses Capistrano to push these files out target servers and restarts shibd and httpd.  It's usage looks like:

    cap deploy HOST=asr-web-dev4.oit.umn.edu

For each of our target servers we setup Capistrano to have a clone of
this shibboleth_deployer repo structured in the standard way, e.g:

    ls /etc/shibboleth_deployer
        current
        releases
        shared

Setup symlinks to the appropriate config files within
shibboleth_deployer from the places the Native Shibboleth SP expects
files to be, e.g:

(from the /etc/shibboleth dir)
    ln -s /etc/shibboleth_deployer/current/shibboleths_lil_helper/generated/apache_shib_test_server/asr-web-dev4.oit.umn.edu/shibboleth2.xml shibboleth2.xml

    ln -s /etc/shibboleth_deployer/current/shibboleths_lil_helper/generated/apache_shib_test_server/asr-web-dev4.oit.umn.edu/idp_metadata.xml idp_metadata.xml

(from the /etc/httpd/conf.d dir)
    ln -s /etc/shibboleth_deployer/current/shibboleths_lil_helper/generated/apache_shib_test_server/asr-web-dev4.oit.umn.edu/shib_apache.conf shib_apache.conf
