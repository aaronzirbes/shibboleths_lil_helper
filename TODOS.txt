* Incorporate FAQ stuff somehow https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/19256223
* Release as gem


DONE
* Add something that warns LOUDLY to use slh with source control
* Rejigger the default config.rb.erb--simplify and reference documentation
  >>> Add is_key_originator
* Separate metadata and make a verify_metadata command
* verify is_key_originator has been specified somewhere after a strategy
  has been declared
* Eliminate *args from all DSL models, it allows you to mis-used the tool easily (i did) with /protect
* Revert to host level sp metadata instead of all in one
* Put comments in the generated output that specify the documentation associated with it
  For example, above SPSSO: http://www.schemacentral.com/sc/ulex20/e-md_SPSSODescriptor.html
