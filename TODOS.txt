* Eliminate *args from all DSL models, it allows you to mis-used the tool easily (i did) with /protect
* Rejigger the generate metadata command to reflect Chris B's thoughts:
    The OASIS SAML standard for metadata contains the XML schema defining the format of the metadata file.  You can only have one SPSSODescriptor element per EntityDescriptor.

    To handle multiple virtual hosts, you just merge the endpoints (AssertionConsumerService, SingleLogoutService, etc.) you need into a single SPSSODescriptor element.

    (On my to-do list is to document this in a FAQ on our shib wiki since it causes a lot of confusion.)

* Put comments in the generated output that specify the documentation associated with it
  For example, above SPSSO: http://www.schemacentral.com/sc/ulex20/e-md_SPSSODescriptor.html
